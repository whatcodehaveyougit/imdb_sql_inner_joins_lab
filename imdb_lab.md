# TERRIBLE NEWS!

IMDB, the world's most famous internet movie database, has _crashed!_ The Powers That Be have phoned CodeClan and specifically tasked YOU with rebuilding it from scratch! So soon into the course? We tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen!

But help is at hand, because they've given you a spec to work to:

## the new IMDB should have:
  - Movies
    - title
    - genre

  - :star: Stars :star:
    - first name
    - last name

  - Castings
    - movie_id
    - star_id
    - fee

The app should be able to
  - handle CRUD actions for all three models
  - display all the stars for a particular movie
  - and display all the movies a particular star is cast in.

## Extension

Add a budget to your movie model and create a method that will return the remaining budget once all a movie's star's fees have been taken into consideration!
